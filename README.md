# Combating Cyber Threats: Machine Learning for Phishing Website Detection
<ul>
  <li>The project sourced phishing and legitimate URLs from PhishTank and the University of New Brunswick, ensuring a comprehensive representation of web traffic.</li>
  <li>Features were extracted from URLs using multiple techniques, including parsing the address bar for domain-related information and analyzing HTML & JavaScript elements for behavioral indicators like iframe presence and right-click disablement.</li>
  <li>Various machine learning models were trained and evaluated, including Decision Trees, Random Forests, and XGBoost.</li>
  <li>XGBoost emerged as the most effective model for detecting phishing websites based on the project's evaluations.</li>
  <li>The project's findings emphasize the significance of machine learning in cybersecurity, providing a proactive defense mechanism against online threats through accurate phishing website detection.</li>
